# Eddie Peters Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio! This repository showcases my work as a developer and highlights some of the projects I've been working on. 

## About Me
Hi, I'm Eddie Peters, a full-stack JS developer based in Malmö, Sweden. My journey into programming began at Malmö University in 2020, where I discovered my passion for coding and problem-solving. Im recently doing my 20 week long internship at Ourliving in Malmö where i've been creating flexible webcomponents and adding them to a component library with storybook and implemented them in their projects.

Interests
Outside of coding, you'll find me enjoying a good cup of coffee ☕, playing the drums 🥁, listening to some good music 🎵, and pursuing outdoor activities like snowboarding 🏂, skateboarding 🛹, rock climbing 🧗‍♂️, and disc golf 🥏.
